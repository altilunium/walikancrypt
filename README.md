> Above is an example of a banner from Malang City employing Walikan, the distinctive "reverse language" that has become emblematic of Malang culture. The inscription "nakam" (reverse of "makan" – to eat) and "hamur" (reverse of "rumah" – home) were used during COVID-19 restrictions to encourage people to stay home and dine at home.

Walikan, also known as Boso Walikan Malangan, is a playful language form practised in Malang, East Java. It involves reversing the phonetic or orthographic form of words—often from Javanese, Indonesian, or even other languages—while adapting them to Malang’s linguistic patterns.

Emerging in the late 1940s amid the Indonesian struggle for independence, Walikan was initially used by the Gerilya Rakyat Kota (GRK)—city guerrilla fighters—as a covert code. It enabled secure communication and identification among compatriots while confusing enemy spies, particularly those embedded by the Dutch. Suyudi Raharno & Wasito are credited with innovating this linguistic strategy. By intentionally reversing words—and adapting them to suit local pronunciation—he provided a method both stealthy and culturally anchored.

Following the Dutch withdrawal, Walikan persisted, evolving into a symbol of Malangan identity. From the 1950s onwards, its use spread among different social groups. By the 1990s and into the present, Walikan has become a casual, informal language omnipresent in youth interaction, popular media, signage, business names, and day-to-day banter. In 2019, recognizing its cultural significance and fluidity, Malang’s Tourism and Culture Office, in collaboration with Universitas Brawijaya, began compiling a dictionary of Walikan to document its evolving vocabulary and usage.
