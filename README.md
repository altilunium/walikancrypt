> Above is an example of a banner from Malang City employing Walikan, the distinctive "reverse language" that has become emblematic of Malang culture. The inscription "nakam" (reverse of "makan" – to eat) and "hamur" (reverse of "rumah" – home) were used during COVID-19 restrictions to encourage people to stay home and dine at home.

Walikan, also known as Boso Walikan Malangan, is a playful language form practised in Malang, East Java. It involves reversing the phonetic or orthographic form of words—often from Javanese, Indonesian, or even other languages—while adapting them to Malang’s linguistic patterns.

Emerging in the late 1940s amid the Indonesian struggle for independence, Walikan was initially used by the Gerilya Rakyat Kota (GRK)—city guerrilla fighters—as a covert code. It enabled secure communication and identification among compatriots while confusing enemy spies, particularly those embedded by the Dutch. Suyudi Raharno & Wasito are credited with innovating this linguistic strategy. By intentionally reversing words—and adapting them to suit local pronunciation—he provided a method both stealthy and culturally anchored.

Before, the operations of the Gerilya Rakyat Kota (GRK) in Malang often ended in failure, which was later attributed to leaks of tactical and strategic information. Investigations revealed the presence of enemy spies within their ranks. In response, Suyudi Raharno and Wasito devised a coded communication system known as boso walikan (reversed language). The system enabled the GRK to distinguish genuine fighters from infiltrators, as it became evident that much of the information leakage occurred in local coffee stalls, where GRK members frequently gathered. Dutch intelligence agents, often local civilians in disguise as food vendors, cigarette sellers, or stall attendants, had infiltrated these spaces. The adoption of boso walikan strengthened the GRK’s internal cohesion and facilitated effective guerrilla operations, including scorched earth tactics, bridge demolitions, ambushes, and the targeting of enemy spies. The solidarity and close daily interactions among GRK fighters allowed them to quickly master the code, leaving enemy agents unable to adapt and ultimately exposed.
Suyudi Raharno was later killed in action when ambushed by Dutch forces in September 1949 at Dukuh Gunuk Watu. Wasito also died in combat during a battle in Gandongan. Both figures are buried at the Suropati Heroes’ Cemetery on Jalan Veteran, Malang.

Following the Dutch withdrawal, Walikan persisted, evolving into a symbol of Malangan identity. From the 1950s onwards, its use spread among different social groups. By the 1990s and into the present, Walikan has become a casual, informal language omnipresent in youth interaction, popular media, signage, business names, and day-to-day banter. In 2019, recognizing its cultural significance and fluidity, Malang’s Tourism and Culture Office, in collaboration with Universitas Brawijaya, began compiling a dictionary of Walikan to document its evolving vocabulary and usage.
